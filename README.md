## **Calculator App**

Create an app that performs basic calculator functionality using React as shown in the screenshot below. The calculator app should be designed using tailwindcss.

The video below shows that the app should work so that if you choose the operation, the numbers you entered before will disappear. 

For example, if you enter 2 + 3 instead of choosing the equal sign operator you choose another operator the app should show first the result of the first operation and proceed to the next.

## Todo App

Build a react to-do app that performs basic tasks such as adding a to-do, marking it as completed, and deleting it.

To make the design, you can use tailwindcss and fontawesome for the icons.

A checkbox on the to-do list marks the task as completed. Keep in mind that a completed task should be displayed with the name struck through

eg: ~~IAMHere~~
